# FBI-Team-Aqua-Theme
This is a Team Aqua Theme that I made for the 3DS Homebrew tool, FBI, coincidentaly also because of boredom.

This has been tested and approved.

Instructions: Click "Clone or Download" Click "Download ZIP" Extract the .zip Place all the .png files into 3DS:/fbi/theme/. If those directories dont exist, create them. Do not move any other files because FBI won't read them. Enjoy
